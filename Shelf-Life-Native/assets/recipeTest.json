This delectable canned chicken was carefully procured from the heavens of Canned Chickenâ„¢'s finest ovens, tender enough to let the chicken simply slide from our bowls to the inside of the can, no force required. This chicken then hardens back into the lovable chicken consistency that people around the world have been able to enjoy. Take this canned chicken on the road, or even into battle without ever worrying that it'll spoil thanks to the pateneted can surrounding it.",
